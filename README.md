# Git-battle ReactJS

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

[Demo](https://githubapi-battle.netlify.app/)

Here, you can:

- search github repositories by language and/or by name;
- go to the repository page on github;
- battle repositories by stars.

To start the app do (development):

- _npm install_
- _npm start_

I used:

- ReactJS: functional components and hooks
- React-router-dom
- Yup to validate the searchline
- SASS
- GITHUB API
- Axios
- Material-UI
- Netlify for Demo
